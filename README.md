*Requires Python 3.8+*

**Change the credentials to your own, install the dependencies and add ChromeDriver to PATH.**

**Run at your own risk. I do not recommend using this bot on your own IG account.**

The script works great as of now, here are a few reasons why your script may not work:

 1) If you get a token error from MYIGBot, try logging into IG on your machine's browser. If your account is brand new, mass following will trigger the instagram bot detection and may result in a softban. I recommend using 5+ month old IG accounts.
 2) ChromeDriver errors may be result of: 1) Your ChromeDriver is outdated. 2) ChromeDriver is not in PATH. You can fix this by putting it there or specifying the driver location. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40555930/selenium-chromedriver-executable-needs-to-be-in-path
 3) If the script has not been updated recently, there's a good chance it is outdated.

I plan on updating the script on release of the like feature.

I didn't really plan to publish this script as first, but since the LikeGram team made it almost impossible to reach the withdrawal limit by hand and included other sneaky stuff, I chose to do so.

**This script will by no means make you lots of money. My main reason behind creating this was to see if this site is a scam or not.**
